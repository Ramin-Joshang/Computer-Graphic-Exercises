# Computer Graphics Exercises with OpenGL

This repository contains a collection of exercises for the **Computer Graphics** course, implemented using **OpenGL**. The exercises are designed to help students understand and practice the fundamentals of computer graphics, 3D rendering, transformations, shading, and other core concepts in the field.

## Setup

To run these exercises locally, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- **OpenGL** (version 3.3 or higher)
- **GLFW** (for windowing and input handling)
- **GLEW** (to manage OpenGL extensions)
- **CMake** (for building the project)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ramin-Joshang/Computer-Graphic-Exercises.git
    cd Computer-Graphic-Exercises
    ```

2. Build the project using CMake:

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

3. Run the exercises:

    ```bash
    ./exercise_1  # Or the corresponding exercise executable
    ```

## Exercises Overview

### Exercise 1: Basic OpenGL Setup
Set up a basic OpenGL environment and create a simple window.

### Exercise 2: Drawing 2D Shapes
Learn how to render basic 2D shapes such as squares, circles, and lines.

### Exercise 3: Shaders and Program Pipeline
Create and use shaders for rendering objects with customized colors and effects.

### Exercise 4: 3D Transformations
Implement 3D transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling to manipulate objects.

### Exercise 5: Camera and Projection
Set up a camera and projection system for rendering 3D scenes with different perspectives.

### Exercise 6: Lighting and Shading
Implement basic lighting models (ambient, diffuse, specular) and shading techniques.

### Exercise 7: Textures
Learn how to apply textures to 3D models for more realistic rendering.

### Exercise 8: Advanced Lighting Techniques
Experiment with advanced lighting models like Phong shading and normal mapping.

### Exercise 9: Model Loading
Load and render 3D models from external files (e.g., .obj format).

### Exercise 10: Framebuffers and Post-Processing
Create custom framebuffers and apply post-processing effects like bloom and blur.

### Exercise 11: Animation
Implement basic animations using keyframes and interpolation techniques.

### Exercise 12: Particle Systems
Create and render particle systems for special effects like fire, smoke, and explosions.

### Exercise 13: Ray Tracing (Advanced)
Implement basic ray tracing algorithms for rendering realistic reflections, refractions, and shadows.
